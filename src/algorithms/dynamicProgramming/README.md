Dynamic Programming: Using calculated solution for smaller part of the problem to calculate the big problem solution

- Memoization: caching the call to function to skip executing it again and return the cached value
- Tabulation

Memoization Recipe

- make it work
- visualize the problem as tree
- implement the tree using recursion
- test it
- make it efficient
- add memo object
- add a base case to return memo values
- store return values into memo

Tabulation Recipe

- visualize the problem as table
- size the problem based on the inputs
- initialize the table with default values
- seed the trivial answer into the table
- iterate throw the table
- fill further positions based on the current positions
